**Something about me**
I understood that I get the most pleasure when I learning something new. So it is the main reason why Iâ€™ve decided to try education in rs school.
If we talk about my strengths, these are definitely sociability and ability to achieve the goal at any cost. Despite this, I am a team worker and I always prioritize the interests and goals of the team. I can spend hours studying new information that really interests me. I dont afraid of difficult tasks and prefer to solve problems in a short time. I hope that education in rs school will give me new usefull skills and knowledge. And it will help me to connect my life with this sphere in the future.
